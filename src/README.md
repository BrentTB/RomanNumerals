# RomanNumerals
This program allows you to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals, or vice versa

The program also lets you print all the Roman Numerals from a start number to an end number

It works with any positive number until the max long value. 

There are few validation checks, so try to enter the data correctly. 

_ represents *1000, so while V is 5, _V is 5000 and __V is 5000 000, etc. 
except for _I which doesn't exist, as that is M (and __I is _M)

Converting Numbers to Roman Numerals:

"5000" will print the Roman Numeral of 5000,

"a5000" will print all the Roman Numerals from 1 to 5000 (can be any non-digit at the front)

"aa4000 5000" will print all the Roman Numerals from 4000 to 5000 (can be any two non-digits at the front, but it has to use a space)
